            <h4>WARNING! When submitting an appeal, it is mandatory to provide the current address of residence as well as the correspondence address and PESEL number of the punished person in order to properly verify the passenger</h4>
            <h3>APPEALS ON CREDIT ADDITIONAL CHARGES (CAC)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Deadlines for submitting appeals: 3 months (from the date of the event) - for imposing an additional credit fee (the date of receipt of the appeal or the postmark). An appeal submitted after this date shall not be examined, regardless of its merits</li>
                <li>Appeals may be submitted by letter, e-mail or in person</li>
                <li>Filing an appeal does not suspend payment deadlines. It is recommended to make the payment within the indicated period, even in the event of an appeal. In the event of a negative response to the appeal submitted, additional costs may arise (e.g. interest, vindication claim). The case may also be referred to vindication or to the court</li>
                <li>The time for considering the appeal is up to 30 days</li>
                <li>In the event of a repeated appeal against the received decision issued by Trans Kontrol, the letter will remain unanswered, unless its content gives rise to new circumstances justifying the submission of another appeal.</li>
                <li>In order to file an appeal or complaint, you can use our template:</li>

            <h3>HANDLING FEE (HE)</h3>
            <p>This is a fee that is usually imposed in exchange for an additional credit fee (only in the case of a reasonable fee). If the entitlement is documented (e.g. for free or discounted travel, or after presenting a valid personal ticket), the additional fee is canceled within 7 days of the event, and a handling fee is imposed in return (provided that it is permitted).</p>

            <h3>VINDICATION</h3>
            <p>If the payment is not made within the prescribed period (see the instruction on the Additional Fee), statutory interest and other costs resulting from legal provisions are added. In addition, the summons may contain a summons to pay the vindication claim, i.e. the amount that the vindication company has collected as remuneration for carrying out vindication activities.</p>
            <p>Vindication may be outsourced to an external vindication company. In the case of unsuccessful recovery, the case is referred to the locally competent court, and after obtaining the payment order, in the event of failure to settle the obligation, the case is transferred to bailiff proceedings.</p>

This claim does not increase the Debtor's indebtedness, however, it causes the Creditor to claim the right to claim the amount of the claim through court proceedings.
