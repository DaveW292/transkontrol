        <h2>STATISTICS, EVENTS, PERSONAL DATA INCIDENTS</h2>
        <article>
            <p>At this point, we would like to familiarize you with the events that have taken place recently. We obtained these events from our Appeals and Complaints Department and from the Inspector for Personal Data Protection. We present here incidents related to the protection of personal data and a number of content of persons fined with an additional fee and other passengers, as well as information and findings on the presented case obtained during the investigation.</p>
            <p>In this way, we would like to introduce you to the work of the auditors and our employees dealing with complaints about them. Based on these cases, it is not difficult to form an opinion about the legitimacy of many complaints about the work of the inspectors. As you will see for yourself, the work of ticket controllers is not the easiest one, and it is not well perceived by the majority of the society. It is a big social problem, because the great tolerance of the local community towards "free riders" means that such people do not feel any pressure from this side. Unfortunately, such a situation leads to the belief that the use of public means of municipal or communal transport without payment for the service is becoming the norm. However, we are convinced that this situation will improve, thanks, among other things, to activities such as ours.</p>

                    <li>obtaining by third parties, to the detriment of the person whose data has been breached, loans from non-banking institutions because many such institutions allow you to obtain a loan or credit in an easy and quick way, e.g. via the Internet or by phone without the need to show an identity document</li>

These data never reached the Trans Kontrol office and were not processed by us. The scope of lost data described in the above-mentioned Incidents is only approximate, because the information comes from the controller, on the basis of a memory report prepared by him.</b>
                <b>Finally, it may turn out that the scope of lost data was smaller than reported by the DPO. In the notification, the DPO quoted the largest possible range of data that could have been breached.</b>
                <b>Currently, appropriate procedures have been implemented to identify data subjects. To this end, an action plan was developed and implemented, which consisted, inter alia, of the continuous and regular monitoring of ancillary charges and money transfers related to ancillary charges in a database. In the event of disclosure of persons affected by the violation, appropriate remedial steps will be taken (as above, but personalized).</b>
